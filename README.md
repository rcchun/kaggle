otto group producrt classification challenge

이번 과제는 세계 최대의 전자상거래 회사 중 하나인 Otto Group에서 주최하는 Otto Group Product Classification Challenge 경진대회에 참석해보겠습니다.
Otto Group은 익명화(anonymization)된 상품 정보에 대한 데이터를 제공하는데, 경진대회 참석자는 이 데이터를 활용하여 주어진 상품 카테고리(target)를 예측해야 합니다. 상품 카테고리는 Class_1부터 Class_9까지 총 9개가 있습니다. 주어진 데이터를 Decision Tree, Random Forest, 그리고 Gradient Boosting Machine를 활용하여 예측해보도록 하겠습니다.

The Otto Group is one of the world’s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France). We are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line.

A consistent analysis of the performance of our products is crucial. However, due to our diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of our product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.

2nd iteration

For this competition, we have provided a dataset with 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between our main product categories. The winning models will be open sourced.
